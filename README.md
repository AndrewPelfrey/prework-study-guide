# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

 This Webpage is to help me and other students who are taking the journey to learn how to code! These are the notes I have taken as I learned introductions to the different programming languages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even some Git commands. This website will help me study to learn this information easier, and a place I can easily go to if I ever get stuck.
