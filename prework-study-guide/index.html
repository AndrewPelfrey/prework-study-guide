        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hyper-text Markup Language</li>
          <li>Provides content and the basic framework for all pages on the web</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element</li>
        </ul>
        
          <h4>Head Element</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The head element contains the metadata for a web application. Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve the webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance</li>
          <li>Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage
          </li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page</li>
          <li>the html opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document</li>
          <li>Inside the html tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English)</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport
          </li>
          <li>The head element is a container for metadata. meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user won’t see information in the head or meta elements</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Body Element</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The body element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the body element</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
          <li>The h1 is the opening tag and /h1 is the closing tag. The content in between those tags is what is rendered on the page
          </li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text
          </li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. These HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists</li>
          <li>img src="">/img is what is used to add an image to the website </li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content
          </li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages(hyperlink). The href attribute points to the URL for the link a href=””> /a</li>
          <li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content
          </li>


        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Must be changed individually when you want to make a change.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet, goes in the head section, only effects elements on that page</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier
          </li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property
          </li>
          <li>We use HTML elements such as header, footer, and h1 as selectors in the external style sheet and then applied CSS properties to style them</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule
          </li>

        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code
          </li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can create a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit
          </li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: will add the changes we made in the current branch we are working on. Stages the files to be committed
          </li>
          <li>git commit -m "describe what the commit contains": This will commit all the changes we made</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: will double-check if our local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub</li>
          <li>git push origin branch name: Will push the branch with the changes up to your github. Your team members can then review the code before officially adding it to the main branch</li>
          
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value</li>
          <li>After the const keyword, give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in the code</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks</li>
          <li>Use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li>Use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code
          </li>
          <li>Using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to interrupt control flow</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements: The first statement determines the starting point for our loop, the second statement is the condition, The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.
          </li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
        </ul>
